# Fursat
### Weekends in Delhi

Fursat is a simple website designed with the asynchronous Nodejs framework and uses MongoDB hosted on cloud by way of mlab.
It lists places of interest to Delhites for fun visits during weekends. 
Additionally, people can create accounts to post reviews of places they visited or add their own reviews on places other people posted about by way of comments. The purpose of this website is to prevent death of plans because of the excessive time wasted in thinking over "Where to go?" during weekends. Weekends? Fursat is right here!
